            <p class="size">Anything from 45 to 75 characters is widely regarded as a satisfactory line length for a
                single-column
                page set in a serifed text face in a text size. The 66-character line (counting both letters and spaces)
                is widely regarded as ideal. For multiple column work, a better average is 40 to 50 characters.</p>
